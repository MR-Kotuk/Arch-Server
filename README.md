# Arch Server for Web Hosting & Cloud Storage

This repository documents the setup of my personal server built on **Arch Linux Minimal**. It is designed for hosting websites using Docker and Cloudflare, as well as for private cloud storage and remote access. The system is optimized for flexibility, performance, and learning — and serves as a foundation for my pet projects, startup ideas, and personal tools.

## Overview

- **Base OS**: Arch Linux (Minimal)
- **Container Management**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Web Exposure**: Cloudflare for DNS & HTTPS
- **Cloud Storage**: Self-hosted
- **Remote Control**: Secure SSH access
- **Use Case**: Built for learning

## What This Server Can Do

- Host multiple websites and services using Docker
- Sync files across devices with a private cloud
- Access and manage everything remotely via SSH
- Serve as a lightweight platform for launching ideas

---

## Skills Demonstrated

This project shows my hands-on experience with:

- Linux system administration (Arch Linux)
- Docker and container orchestration
- Network configuration and DNS management
- Cloudflare API and web infrastructure
- Secure remote server management
- Project architecture and automation

---

## Security Measures

- SSH login via username and password
- Basic firewall rules using `iptables`
- HTTPS and DNS protection via Cloudflare
- Docker container isolation

---

## Why I Built This

I created this server to experiment with cloud technologies and support my own web projects. Everything is self-managed — from system setup to domain routing — which helps me understand the full stack of web infrastructure
